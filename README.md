Play the world famous card game Set!

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this game is to make as many sets as possible, either against the timer or another player.

WHAT IS A SET?

A set is a certain combination of three cards. For each one of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either a) all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version.

Keep in mind that for any two given cards, there is one and only one card in the deck that forms a set with the other two.
